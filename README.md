# Simulating the rattling head movement of the Princess Mononoke spirits

Using an Arduino nano, stepper motors, servo motors, markers, cardboard, hot glue and ultraviolet light, we created a little window scenario for the amusement of our neighbors in halloween. The project was a collaboration of friends and family. My son Pepe and I designed the pattern of movements of the forest spirits.
